# Comma Code:
# Suppose you have a list of values:
# spam = ['apples', 'bananas', 'tofu', 'cats'].
# Write a function that takes a list value as an argument and returns a string
# with all the items separated by a comma and a space, with "and" inserted
# before the last item. For example, passing the previous `spam` list to the
# function would return "apples, bananas, tofu, and cats". But your function
# should be able to work with any list value passed to it.
